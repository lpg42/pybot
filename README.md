# pybot
a discord / youtube interface bot (with cogs)

YOUTUBE DL WAS DEPRECATED FOR A BIT (? what the heck google.. 4Weird ??) Current status of bot: working but not really functional. Just a code snippet example for now. Good reg ex and async examples though. I had some of the main stuff for youtube-dl commented out, but I uncommented for visibilty even if this script no longer works with that portion of code active (untested). Without the deprecated youtube-dl library snippets, it is tested and works but doesn't really do much (basically a starter template)

New bot, new langauge to be added soon - entirely functional and operating on personal discord.
